# TASK NAME  
Keylogger Creation for Educational Use

---

## OBJECTIVE  
To build a basic keylogger using Python and the `pynput` library in order to understand how attackers capture keystrokes and how such methods can be detected and prevented.

---

## STEPS  

1. Created a Python script `keylogger_demo.py` to log keyboard input.  

2. Executed the script in the terminal:

3. Typed something.

4. Stopeed Keylogger and checked files.

## CONCLUSION  

This activity showed how easily a keylogger can be created using Python, emphasizing the need for cybersecurity vigilance. By understanding how keystrokes can be captured, one can better detect, prevent, and respond to such threats. Preventive strategies include using antivirus software, monitoring running processes, and regularly auditing system behavior for suspicious activities.
